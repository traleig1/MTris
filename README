This version of Tetris implements most of the rules of guideline
Tetris, including SRS (rotation system) with wall kicks. The wall
kick code has been written in such a way to make it reasonably
simple to implement other rotation systems as well.
I have chosen, however, to only implement line counts, not scoring,
and so T-Spins and board clears are not acknowledged, as per old-school
Tetris rules.

There are essentially 3 layers to the code: The Engine,
the UI State Machine, and the OS Wrapper
  Engine - This layer, composed of the Tetris class and all of the classes
        it contains, encapsulates all of the rules for the main game mode.
  UI State Machine - This layer uses instances of the abstract State class
        to describe each screen/mode of the game. Each State describes how
        it should be drawn, how input should be processed, and how it
        should transition to other states.
        This layer also contains an abstract instance of the Game class,
        which provides some useful drawing abstractions.
  OS Wrapper - This layer provides a concrete instance of the Game class
        by providing wrappers for the necessary OS/GUI toolkit-dependent
        drawing functions, and a structure with references to the game's
        images.

Future Versions:
 - More Animations
 - Fadeout/fadein transition states
 - Network Multiplayer
